THE RED HAT ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT   
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE PURCHASING AND/OR USING SOFTWARE OR SERVICES FROM RED HAT. 
BY USING RED HAT SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, CLIENT SIGNIFIES ITS ASSENT TO AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT AND 
ACKNOWLEDGES  IT  HAS  READ AND  UNDERSTANDS  THIS  AGREEMENT. AN  INDIVIDUAL ACTING  ON  BEHALF  OF AN  ENTITY 
REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF CLIENT 
DOES  NOT ACCEPT  THE  TERMS  OF  THIS AGREEMENT,  THEN  IT  MUST  NOT  USE  RED  HAT  SOFTWARE  OR  SERVICES.  THIS 
AGREEMENT INCORPORATES THE PRODUCT APPENDICES REFERENCED BY URL IN THIS AGREEMENT. 
 
This Red Hat Enterprise Agreement is between the Client and Red Hat, Inc. (“Red Hat”) and addresses unique commercial considerations that 
apply to Red Hat Products, open source software, and our subscription business model. 
  
1. The Mechanics of the Agreement 
1.1 Ordering. The Agreement applies to Red Hat Products that you purchase or for which you acquire the right to access or use, including 
Subscriptions, Professional Services, Training Services, access to Red Hat Online Properties and other Red Hat offerings, whether obtained 
directly from Red Hat or from a Red Hat Business Partner. You may order Red Hat Products directly from Red Hat by submitting an Order 
Form or from a Red Hat Business Partner using the Business Partner’s ordering procedure.  Affiliates of either party may conduct business 
under this Agreement by signing an Order Form or other document that references these General Terms and may include additional terms 
relating to local requirements or other transaction details. 
1.2 Structure.  The Agreement consists of three components: (1) the General Terms; (2) the Product Appendices (which may include end user 
license agreements) applicable to Your Products; and (3) if applicable, all Order Forms.  Certain terms are defined in the General Terms or in 
the Definitions section at the end of the General Terms.  If you order Red Hat Products from a Business Partner, then any agreement that you 
enter into with the Business Partner is solely between you and the Business Partner and will not be binding on Red Hat. 
 
2. Term 
2.1 Agreement Term. The Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues until it is terminated as set forth below.   
2.2 Services Term. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Service that you order will start at the earlier of (a) your first use of the Service, (b) the 
date you purchased the Service, or (c) the start date contained in the Order Form, and, in each case, will end at the expiration of the Services 
Term unless sooner terminated as set forth below.  Subscriptions automatically renew for successive terms of the same duration as the 
original Services Term, unless either party gives written notice to the other party of its intention not to renew at least thirty (30) days before the 
expiration of the applicable Services Term. Any Services that you order must be consumed during the applicable Services Term and any 
unused Services will expire. 
 
3. Fees and Payment 
3.1 Payment of Fees.  Section 3.1 applies only to Red Hat Products ordered directly from Red Hat.  The payment terms applicable to Red Hat 
Products purchased from a Business Partner are included in your Business Partner agreement. 
a) Unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form, you agree to pay Fees (1) for Professional Services and Training Services at the time of 
your order; and (2) for Subscriptions no later than 30 days after the date of Red Hat’s invoice.  Credit is subject to Red Hat’s approval 
and Red Hat may change credit terms.   
b) Fees do not include reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, shipping costs, Taxes, or service provider fees (such as payment processor or 
vendor management) and you agree to pay such amounts or reimburse Red Hat for such amounts paid or payable by Red Hat.  You 
must pay the Fees and expenses without withholding or deduction.  If you are required to withhold or deduct any Taxes from the Fees or 
expenses, then you agree to increase the amount payable to Red Hat by the amount of such Taxes so that Red Hat receives the full 
amount of all Fees and expenses.  All Fees, expenses and other amounts paid under the Agreement are non-refundable.  
c) If you are purchasing by credit card, then you (1) authorize Red Hat to charge your credit card for all amounts due, and (2) agree to 
provide updated credit card information to Red Hat as needed to pay the Fees or other amounts owed. 
3.2 Basis of Fees. Fees are determined by counting the Units associated with the applicable Red Hat Product. For example, Subscriptions may 
be priced based on the number of systems or nodes. You agree to order and pay for the appropriate type and quantity of Red Hat Products 
based on the Units you use or deploy. If during the term of the Agreement, the actual number of Units you use or deploy exceeds the number 
of Units you have ordered and paid for, you must promptly report to Red Hat or a Business Partner the number of additional Units used or 
deployed and the date(s) on which they were used or deployed. Red Hat (or the Business Partner) will invoice you and you agree to pay for 
the additional Units in accordance with your approved payment terms.  
 
4. Termination 
4.1 Termination for Cause.  Either party may terminate this Agreement (in whole or with respect to any Order Form or Red Hat Product obtained 
from Red Hat or a Business Partner) by notice to the other party if (a) the other party materially breaches this Agreement, and does not cure 
the breach within thirty (30) days after written notice (except in the case of a breach of Section 9 in which case no cure period will apply), or (b) 
the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or 
assignment for the benefit of creditors.  In addition, Red Hat may, at its option and without limiting its other remedies, suspend (rather than 
terminate) any Services if you breach the Agreement (including with respect to payment of Fees) until the breach is remedied.  
4.2 Termination for Convenience.  Either party may terminate the Agreement by notice to the other party at any time if all Services Terms have 
expired.  
4.3 Effect of Termination; Survival.  The termination or suspension of an individual Order Form, Business Partner order or any Red Hat 
Products purchased from Red Hat or a Business Partner will not terminate or suspend any other Order Form, Business Partner order, Red Hat 
Product or the remainder of the Agreement unless specified in the notice of termination or suspension.  If the Agreement is terminated in 
whole, all outstanding Order Form(s), Business Partner orders and Services will terminate.  If this Agreement, any Order Form or Business 
Partner order is terminated, you agree to pay for all Units that you used or deployed or that were provided by Red Hat up to the effective date 
of termination.  Sections 1.2, 3, 4.3, 5.2, 5.3, 9 (to the extent set forth therein), 10, 11 (to the extent set forth therein) and 12-15 will survive the 
termination of this Agreement.

5.1 Red Hat represents and warrants that (a) it has the authority to enter into this Agreement, (b) the Services will be performed in a professional 
and workmanlike manner by qualified personnel, (c) to its knowledge, the Software does not, at the time of delivery to you, include malicious

HAT PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND 
RED  HAT  DISCLAIMS  ALL  SUCH  REPRESENTATIONS  AND  WARRANTIES,  INCLUDING  THE  IMPLIED  WARRANTIES  OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY THE 
COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.  RED HAT AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE RED 
HAT PRODUCTS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, ERROR FREE, ACCURATE OR COMPLETE OR COMPLY WITH REGULATORY 
REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT RED HAT WILL CORRECT ALL ERRORS. IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH 
IN  SECTION  5.1,  YOUR  EXCLUSIVE  REMEDY,  AND  RED  HAT’S  ENTIRE  LIABILITY,  WILL  BE  THE  RE-PERFORMANCE  OR  RE-
DELIVERY  OF  THE  DEFICIENT  RED  HAT  PRODUCT,  OR  IF  RED  HAT  CANNOT  SUBSTANTIALLY  CORRECT  A  BREACH  IN  A 
COMMERCIALLY  REASONABLE  MANNER,  TERMINATION  OF  THE  RELEVANT  RED  HAT  PRODUCT,  IN  WHICH  CASE  YOU  MAY 
RECEIVE A PRO RATA REFUND OF THE FEES PAID FOR THE DEFICIENT RED HAT PRODUCT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF 
TERMINATION.   
5.3 The Red Hat Products have not been tested in all situations under which they may be used. Red Hat will not be liable for the results obtained 
through use of the Red Hat Products and you are solely responsible for determining appropriate uses for the Red Hat Products and for all 
results of such use.  In particular, Red Hat Products are not specifically designed, manufactured or intended for use in (a) the design, planning,

weapons systems, (d) direct life support systems (e) or other similar hazardous environments.   
 
6. Open Source Assurance. Purchases of Subscriptions may entitle you to participate in Red Hat’s Open Source Assurance Program, which 
is described at http://www.redhat.com/rhel/details/assurance/ and provides certain protections in the event of a third party infringement claim. 
The terms for this optional program are subject to the agreement at http://www.redhat.com/legal/open_source_assurance_agreement.html. 
 
7. Red Hat Online Properties. You may be required to create an Account to access Red Hat Online Properties. You agree to provide 
accurate information when creating an Account.  You may not access or create multiple accounts in a manner that is intended to avoid, or has 
the effect of avoiding, payment of Fees or circumventing thresholds or Unit limitations associated with your Account or otherwise in a manner 
intended to violate the Agreement. You are solely responsible for all activities in connection with your Account and will notify Red Hat promptly 
if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your Account.  Your use of and access to the Red Hat Online Properties may also be subject 
to the Product Appendices applicable to the Red Hat Product. 
 
8. Evaluations. Red Hat may offer Evaluation Subscriptions for evaluation and not for production purposes.  Evaluation Subscriptions may be 
provided with limited or no support or subject to other limitations. 
 
9. Confidentiality 
9.1 Recipient (a) may not disclose Confidential Information of a Discloser to any third party unless Discloser approves the disclosure in writing or 
the disclosure is otherwise permitted under this Section 9; (b) will use the same degree of care to protect Confidential Information of Discloser 
as it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable care; and (c) may disclose 
Confidential Information of the Discloser only to its employees, Affiliates, agents and contractors with a need to know, and to its auditors and 
legal counsel, in each case, who are under a written obligation (or other professional obligation) to keep such information confidential using 
standards of confidentiality no less restrictive than those required by this Section 9. These obligations will continue for a period of two (2) years 
following initial disclosure of the particular Confidential Information.  A Recipient may disclose Confidential Information if it is required to do so 
by applicable law, regulation or court order but, where legally permissible, will provide advance notice to the Discloser to enable the Discloser 
to  seek  a  protective  order  or  other  similar  protection  if  feasible.    “Recipient”  is  the  party  receiving  Confidential  Information  under  this 
Agreement.  “Discloser” is a party disclosing Confidential Information under this Agreement. 
9.2 Information is not Confidential Information, if: (a) the information is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of the Recipient’s 
breach of this Agreement, (b) the Recipient, at the time of disclosure, knows or possesses the information without obligation of confidentiality 
or thereafter obtains the information from a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality; (c) the Recipient independently develops the 
information without use of the Discloser’s Confidential Information,  (d) the information is generally known or easily developed by someone 
with ordinary skills in the business of the Recipient, or (e) the information is licensed under an Open Source License (as defined by the Open 
Source Initiative (https://opensource.org/)). 
9.3 Confidential Information that is disclosed prior to termination of this Agreement will remain subject to this Agreement for the period set forth 
above. Upon written request of the Discloser, the Recipient will promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information, except for Confidential 
Information stored in routine back-up media not accessible during the ordinary course of business. 
 
10. Client Information, Feedback, Reservation of Rights, & Review  
10.1 Client Information.  If you provide Client Information in connection with your use of or access to Red Hat Products, you agree that, subject to 
Section 9, Red Hat, its Affiliates, and Suppliers may use such Client Information in connection with providing the Red Hat Products.  You agree 
that your provision (and Red Hat’s use) of Client Information under this Agreement does not require any additional consents or licenses, will be 
in compliance with applicable law, and will not violate any intellectual property, proprietary, privacy, or other right of any third party.  As between 
Red Hat and you, you retain all other rights in and to Client Information. 
10.2 Feedback.  You may be asked to voluntarily provide Red Hat with Feedback in connection with Red Hat Products, but have no obligation to do 
so.  If you choose to do so, Red Hat may use Feedback for any purpose, including incorporating the Feedback into, or using the Feedback to 
develop and improve Red Hat Products and other Red Hat offerings without attribution or compensation. You grant Red Hat a perpetual and 
irrevocable license to use all Feedback for any purpose.  You agree to provide Feedback to Red Hat only in compliance with applicable laws 
and you represent that you have the authority to provide the Feedback and that Feedback will not include proprietary information of a third 
party.   
10.3 Reservation of Rights.  Red Hat grants to you only those rights expressly granted in the Agreement with respect to the Red Hat Products and 
reserves all other rights in and to the Red Hat Products (including all intellectual property rights).  Red Hat may collect and use for any 
purpose aggregate anonymous benchmark data about your use of the Red Hat Products. Nothing in this Agreement will limit Red Hat from 
providing software, materials, or services for itself or other clients, irrespective of the possible similarity of such software, materials or services 
to those that might be delivered to you. The terms of Section 9 will not prohibit or restrict either party's right to develop, use or market products 
or  services  similar  to  or  competitive  with  the  other  party;  provided,  however,  that  neither  party  is  relieved  of  its  obligations  under  this 
Agreement.  
 
11. Review. While this Agreement is in effect and for one year thereafter, Red Hat or its designee, acting in accordance with Section 9, may 
inspect your facilities and records to verify your compliance with this Agreement. You agree to (a) respond promptly to requests for information, 
documents and/or records, (b) grant appropriate access for on-site visits in order to verify your compliance, and (c) reasonably cooperate in 
connection with any such verification.  Red Hat will provide at least ten (10) days prior written notice for any on-site visits, and will conduct on-
site visits during regular business hours in a manner that reasonably minimizes interference with your business.  If Red Hat notifies you of any 
noncompliance or underpayment, then you will resolve the non-compliance and/or underpayment within fifteen (15) days from the date of 
notice.  If the underpayment exceeds five percent (5%), then you will also reimburse Red Hat for the cost of the inspection.

U.S. government restricted persons list, including those who have been prohibited from participating in U.S. export transactions by any federal 
agency of the U.S. government.  You will not provide to Red Hat any data or engage Red Hat in any activity, in each case, that could constitute 
the development of a “defense article” or provision of a “defense service” to you, as these terms are defined in Section 120 of the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  In addition, you will not, and will not allow third parties under your control, (i) to provide Red Hat with Client

14.3 Assignment.  Either  party  may  upon  written  notice:  (a)  assign  this  Agreement  to  an  Affiliate  if  the  Affiliate’s  financial  condition  and 
creditworthiness are sufficient to satisfy the assigning party’s obligations under the Agreement and the assignment will not affect the non-
assigning party’s obligations under the Agreement; and (b) assign this Agreement to a successor or acquirer pursuant to a merger or sale of all 
or substantially all of such party’s assets. Any other assignment will be deemed void and ineffective without the prior written consent of the 
other party.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective 
successors and permitted assigns. 
14.4 Waiver. A waiver by a party under this Agreement is only valid if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of such party.  A delay or 
failure of a party to exercise any rights under this Agreement will not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights.

agency relationship between the parties or any Affiliate. Each party is solely responsible for supervision, control and payment of its personnel. 
Red Hat may subcontract Services to third parties or Affiliates as long as (a) subcontractors agree to protect Confidential Information and (b) 
Red Hat remains responsible to you for performance of its obligations. 
14.6 Third  Party  Beneficiaries.  This Agreement  is  binding  on  the  parties  to  this Agreement  and,  other  than  as  expressly  provided  in  the

causes beyond its reasonable control.  
14.8 Complete Agreement and Order of Precedence. The Agreement represents the complete agreement between the parties with respect to its 
subject matter and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and proposals, whether written or oral, with respect to such subject 
matter.  Any terms contained in any other documentation that you deliver to Red Hat, including any purchase order or other order-related 
document (other than an Order Form), are void and will not become part of the Agreement or otherwise bind the parties.  If there is a conflict 
between the General Terms, the  Product Appendices and/or an Order Form, the General Terms will  control  unless otherwise expressly 
provided in the Product Appendices and/or Order Form.   
14.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which will constitute one 
and the same document. The parties may exchange signature pages by email or electronic signature process and such signatures will be 
effective to bind the parties to the Agreement.  
14.10 Severable. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining 
provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect to the greatest extent permitted by law.
